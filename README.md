## Description

Pessism or realism? Things seem to get worse every year but we can try to take it in stride. This small project is a twist on typical fortune cookies and is meant for entertainment purposes only. Like all fortune cookies it should not be taken seriously. It has over 30 misfortunes that are randomly rendered on opening a cookie.
